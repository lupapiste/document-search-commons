# document-search-commons

Common document search related code shared between lupadoku and onkalo applications.

Sass styles are built with node sass:

    npm run sass:prod

During development you can watch the directory and automatically rebuild with: 

    npm run sass:watch

You should combine this by running shadow-cljs compilation in lupadoku or onkalo, which will reload the changed CSS file.
